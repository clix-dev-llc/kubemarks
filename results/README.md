# Results folder

This folder contains some results of the original [PerfKitBenchmarker](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker) repository.\
Please note that the [custom fork](https://github.com/marcomicera/PerfKitBenchmarker) has not been used to generate these results, so `.csv` files might lack of some additional information added by the fork only, i.e., the physical node IDs on which benchmarks were executed.\
You can see all these changes brought by the fork [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/compare/master...marcomicera:master).
`.log` files have been left untouched.
