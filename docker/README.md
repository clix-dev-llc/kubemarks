# Dockerfiles folder

This folder contains the two Dockerfiles used in this project.\
Every folder contains a handy `build_and_upload.sh` script which builds and uploads images to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).\
For more info, please have a look at the ["Docker images" section](../doc/README.md#docker-images) of the documentation.
